# Terragrunt Language Server

This is a simple language server for [Terragrunt](https://terragrunt.gruntwork.io/).

## Capabilities

The capabilities of this language server are documented in the [server capabilities documentation](./docs/server-capabilities.md).

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome, though the maintainers request your patience and understanding, as this is not a project we can dedicate a lot of time to.

If you would like to contribute, please read the [contributing documentation](./docs/contributing.md) file.

## Special Thanks

A special thanks also goes to [jowharshamshiri](https://github.com/jowharshamshiri) for getting the ball rolling on [tg-hcl-lsp](https://github.com/jowharshamshiri/tg-hcl-lsp), the first community supported Terragrunt Language Server. Seeing the community commit to creating a Language Server on their own convinced the maintainers of Terragrunt to create this official version.

This one was created by learning from [tjdevries](https://github.com/tjdevries)'s [educational-lsp](https://github.com/tjdevries/educationalsp), and that educational example served as a great Golang-based starting point for this project.
